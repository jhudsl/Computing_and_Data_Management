## General Computing Considerations

Choosing a [computing platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform) depends on several considerations.  

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "General Considerations: 1. What type of interface is needed? 2. Will data need extra privacy protection? 3. How computationally intensive will the work be? 4.How much data storage is needed?", out.width="100%"}
ottr::include_slide("hhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0/edit#slide=id.g115e0d5ae79_0_5")
```


Asking yourself and your research team the following questions can help you find the right computing platform.

### Interface

Will you need a [graphical interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface), a [command line interface](https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/command-line-interface-CLI), or both?

What do we mean by this?

A [graphical user interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) or simply just graphical interface or GUI, allows for users to choose functions to perform by interacting with visual representations. They have a "user-centered" design that creates a visual environment where users can for example **click on** tabs, boxes, or icons for to perform functions. This also often allows users to more directly see plots and other types of visualizations.

[Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) offers a graphical user interface for performing analyses and tasks. For example in the following image we show a GUI for joining two files:

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Galaxy Graphical User Interface", out.width="100%"}
ottr::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0/edit#slide=id.gf9c252d058_0_33")
```


Another Graphical User Interface example comes from the [OHIF image viewer](https://ohif.org) which has a tool bar for modifying, viewing and annotating images.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "The OHIF Graphical User Interface has an image viewer (center) which  includes a tool bar (above center) to modify, view, and annotate images. A menu on the left allows users to access images related to the current patient in other studies, and a menu on the right is used for making measurements and exporting measurement reports.", out.width="100%"}
ottr::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0/edit#slide=id.gfd8d3f477a_159_2")
```


A [command line interface](https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/command-line-interface-CLI) (also known as a character interface) allows for software functions to be performed by specifying through commands written in text. This typically offers more control than a graphical interface, however command line interfaces are often less user friendly as they require that the user know the correct commands to use.

For example, one could perform functions in R using Bioconductor packages such as [Biostrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html) with a command line interface:

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Command line interface using R and Bioconductor package", out.width="100%"}
ottr::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0/edit#slide=id.g115e0d5ae79_0_35")
```



A situation where you might use **both** a command line interface and a GUI, is using [RStudio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio) to perform an analysis in R with Bioconductor packages. [RStudio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio) is what is called an IDE or an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), which is an application that supports writing code. There are many tools to help you including a console for writing code in R with command line interfacing, as well as graphical interface tools. As shown in this example below, one can inspect and save a plot (that was created with the command line) by using a GUI. The plot was created using the same package as the one used in the command line interface example.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Command line interface using R and Bioconductor package with a GUI using RStudio", out.width="100%"}
ottr::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0/edit#slide=id.g115e0d5ae79_0_30")
```

Some cloud computing options will have either interface option while others will only have one. This is an important consideration when you decide what computing resources to use.

## Protected data

Are you working with protected data that requires special security precautions?

If you are working with data that might be protected by [HIPAA](https://www.hipaajournal.com/hipaa-compliance-checklist/), such as electronic health records, then special security measures are required to ensure that only authorized users have access to the data. Be careful about both local and cloud shared computing resources. Sometimes extra privacy and data security measures are built in and at other times, you will need perform extra steps to get the data security and privacy that you need.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "HIPAA Logo", out.width="100%"}
ottr::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0/edit#slide=id.g115e0d5ae79_0_43")
```

### Computation needs

How computationally intensive are my tasks? 

If you have a large amount of data and/or are performing complex analyses, you may require more computational power than your current laptop can provide. If this is the case you might consider using a local server or a cloud computing option (see the previous chapters for more info if you have not already). 

### Storage needs

How much storage space do I need for both temporary and long-term data?


If you are working with large datasets you may also need storage options that go beyond what you currently have available. Local or cloud storage options may work for you, depending on other considerations (security, data transfers). 



## Local shared resources vs cloud

If you have determined that you indeed need more computing power than your personal lab computers. The next decision is between local shared resources and more traditional shared resources like XSEDE, and cloud computing options. See  @fischer_jetstream_2019 for more information about the costs and benefits of using a cloud option like Jetstream for your computational work.


1) Are local resources sufficient? 

When a local computing resource solution already works, one may rightly question the time required to learning how to use a new cloud-based platform. However, when local solutions are insufficient or unsustainable, then the cloud becomes a competitive option.

2) Do you want to work with especially big or controlled access datasets? 

Increasingly large datasets like the [Genotype -Tissue Expression (GTEx)](https://gtexportal.org/home/), [Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000218.v24.p8) or [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) are being stored on the cloud-based platforms. If your work relies on being able to access a large dataset like this, then the cloud may be your only practical option. Furthermore, if you work with data that requires extra privacy protection, more platforms are providing compliance with regulations like HIPAA and [FedRAMP](https://blog.hootsuite.com/what-is-fedramp/).

3) Do you need to work with collaborators?  Computational research increasingly involves larger and larger collaborations. While many systems exist to share work, the cloud platforms make it easier for everyone to share the exact same computational environment including hardware, software, and datasets.

We will now discuss several opportunities and challenges that cloud computing currently presents.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

The state of Cloud computing is continually evolving.  Here, we highlight four main current benefits:


1) **Sharing history**  

The first major benefit is the increasing ease with which one can share and collaborate on research projects. Shown here is the History feature of [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/). Using this, one can share not only what datasets they used but also every computational manipulation that was performed.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Galaxy history example", out.width="100%"}
ottr::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0/edit#slide=id.gf9c252d058_0_38")
```


By sharing such a history, one can reproduce an analysis in its entirety (if they use the same data), allowing collaborators to offer comments and extend upon the work with ease.



2) **Sharing Workflows between Platforms**

While sharing complete analysis histories is for the most part constrained to a particular software platform, a second benefit that has arisen is the ability to share workflows between platforms.[Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/) is a great open-source and free option to share and find bioinformatics workflows that can be launched using different platforms.

Shown here is a diagram of an analysis pipeline to create a [custom reference](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references) for single cell 10x data using [cell ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) published by the Klarman Cell Observatory on [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/workflows/github.com/klarman-cell-observatory/cumulus/Cellranger_create_reference:master?tab=dag). Users can launch the workflow on various supported platforms such as Terra or AnVIL.:

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Workflow on Dockstore showing launch buttons with multiple platforms", out.width="100%"}
ottr::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0/edit#slide=id.g117032ee319_0_8")
```

This higher level abstraction coupled with container technology allows this multistep analysis to be run with relative ease on supporting platforms like Terra, AnVIL, or [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com/), which is yet another computing platform company, although with generally more costs associated as compared to Terra or AnVIL.


3) **Using Commodity Hardware**

The third Benefit we highlight is the increasing ease by which one can provision commodity hardware at scale.  

What this means is that you can pay reasonable costs to complete your analysis in less time by renting hundreds to tens of thousands of Cloud-based computers -- importantly stopping the bill when your analysis is complete.  Specialized hardware like GPUs and large memory nodes are also available for rent allowing you to pay only for what you need.

4) Relative to more traditional shared computing resources, you don't need to worry as much about sharing etiquette with cloud computing options because these resources typically have more than enough to go around. There is a trade off in that you will need to learn how to work with the cloud computing platform, however you can be more independent about what software you use and how many resources you use without bothering others.

### Challenges of Cloud Computing

Balancing these three benefits are four challenges:

1) **Data Transfer**  

Data transfer and data management remains a cumbersome task.  While storing data in the cloud has its advantages, it also has corresponding storage costs. Thus, careful planning is necessary with regards to what data will be stored where, as well as budgeting the time necessary to transfer data back and forth. However if you have yet to start work on a local shared computing resource than the work to transfer may be comparable. Additionally if you plan to use public data that is accessible through a platform designed for research than you may in fact have less data transfer needs when working with a cloud computing option. 

2) **Data Security**  

Most cloud resources offer features that make it easier to access and share data, and these features often come at the **expense of security**. Thus, special precautions must be implemented to securely store protected datasets such as human genome sequences and electronic health records. 

Some of the specialized research platforms allow for this as described in the previous chapter. Make sure you check what is required to set up an extra security protection - often this will not be automatic.

3) **Costs** 

Controlling costs, especially with regards to storage, presents a third formidable challenge.  As many cloud providers naturally want to encourage usage of their platforms, users must be aware of how much money is currently being spent and be able to project how much money is likely to be spent in the future.  

While software platforms can help mitigate these challenges, cloud computing still incurs costs from the underlying hardware providers. 

4) **IT**  

A final challenge is that many IT support staff do not have extensive experience managing cloud resources.  Should IT choose to support analysis on the cloud, they would face the aforementioned challenges of understanding and supporting data management, security compliance, and cost management.  Fortunately, large initiatives like AnVIL, [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/), and CyVerse continue to work on democratizing access to cloud computing by tackling many of these challenges.  

## Overall Decision Process

## Conclusions

We hope that this chapter has given you some more perspective on how to make important computing decisions to make the most out of your work.

In conclusion, here are some of the major take-home messages:

1) The following are important factors to consider when deciding between computing options: 1. Interface needs. 2. data needs for extra privacy protection, 3. computing needs, 4. data storage needs.

2) When making computing decisions, first determine if your local machine has the capacity you need and then decide on local vs remote computing options.

3) More and more cloud computing options are being developed and designed specifically for research, consider the above general factors when choosing between cloud-based options.
