## Motivation

One of the key cancer informatics challenges is dealing with and managing the explosion of large data from multiple sources that are often too large to work with on typical personal computers. This course is designed to help researchers and investigators to understand the basics of computing and to familiarize them with various computing  options to ultimately help guide their decisions on the topic.

## Target Audience 

This course is intended for researchers (including postdocs and students) with limited to intermediate experience with informatics research. The conceptual material will also be useful for those in management roles who are collecting data and using informatics pipelines.

## Curriculum 

The course will cover the key underlying principles and concepts in computing. It will cover concrete discussions of the differences between cloud and local computing. The course will highlight a number of computing options and etiquette for using shared resources.
