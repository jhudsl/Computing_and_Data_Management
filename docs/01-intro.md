## Motivation

One of the key cancer informatics challenges is dealing with and managing the explosion of data from multiple sources. This course is designed to help researchers and investigators to understand the key principles of data management from an economic, privacy, security, usability and discoverability perspective. 

## Target Audience 

This course is intended for researchers (including postdocs and students) with limited to intermediate experience with informatics research. The conceptual material will also be useful for those in management roles who are collecting data and using informatics pipelines.

## Curriculum 

he course will cover the key underlying principles and concepts in data management. It will cover concrete discussions of the economic choices behind cloud and local data management. It will also cover data security, data privacy, IRB and data access requests, and the ethics of good data management. The course will highlight concrete workflows for managing genomic, imaging, and clinical data.
