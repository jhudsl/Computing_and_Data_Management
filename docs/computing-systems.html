<p>This chapter aims to provide research leaders with some guidance about general computing options, such as personal computers, local computing clusters, and cloud options. We will discuss how networks and servers work, as well as cloud computing and we will describe the computing capacity of each option as well as other considerations. virtual machines???</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Data Sizes</h2>
<p>Recall that the smallest unit of data is a bit which is either a zero or a one. A group of a bits is called a bite, and most computers and phones, and software programs are constructed or designed in a way to accommodate groups of bites at a time. For example a 32-bit machine can work with 4 bytes at a time and a 64-bit can work with 8 bytes at a time. But how big is a file? When we sequence a genome, how large is that in terms of binary data? Can our local computer work with the size of data that we would like to work with?</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Checking file sizes on Mac</h3>
<p>If you own a Mac and want to check the size of a particular file, look at your file within a finder window. You can open a new finder window by clicking on the button that looks like a square with two colors and a face, typically in the bottom left corner if your dock or the strip of icons on your screen to help you navigate to different application programs.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_120.png" title="Mac finder button" alt="Mac finder button" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Once you open a finder window, you can navigate to one of your files.</p>
<p>If you have the view setting that looks like 4 lines, you will get information about the size of each file.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_128.png" title="Mac finder button" alt="Mac finder button" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You can right click on a file and click the “Get Info” button. This will give your more specific information.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_133.png" title="Mac finder button" alt="Mac finder button" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Checking file sizes on PC/Windows</h3>
<p>In a similar manner to checking file sizes on a Mac, with a Windows or PC computer, you can navigate to files by first opening the File Explorer application by typing this in the search bar next to the “start” button.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_139.png" title="Mac finder button" alt="Mac finder button" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Then navigate to a file of interest which will show information about the size in one of the columns to the right, if you hover over the file name, you will get more specific information.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Computer Capacity</h2>
<p>Now that we know about the CPU, how many tasks can the CPU of an average computer do these days? How much memory and storage do they typically have?</p>
<p>These values will probably change very soon, but currently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Laptops</strong> can perform 8 CPU tasks at once, storing 16 GB in memory and 1 TB on storage.<br />
This means that typical laptops have 64 Gigabytes for random access memory, to allow the CPU to work on relatively large tasks, and 8TB for the hard drive (and or SSD), meaning that you can store thousands of photos and files like PDFs, word documents etc.</li>
<li><strong>Desktops</strong> can perform similarly and to a degree better than a Laptop for a similar price. Since less work needs to be done to make the desktop small and portable, sometimes you can get better storage and performance for the same price as a Laptop.</li>
<li>Some <strong>phones</strong> can compete with laptops from the not so distant past by performing 6 CPU tasks at once and storing 4 GB in memory and 0.5 TB of storage.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_69.png" title="Result of pressing `About this Mac` button of a typical Mac today" alt="Result of pressing `About this Mac` button of a typical Mac today" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>First we see the operating system is called Mojave.
Next we see that the processor (which we now know is the CPU) is a 2.6 GigaHertz (GHz) Intel Core i7 chip. This means that the processor or CPU can process 2,600,000,000 operations in a second (this is called a clock cycle). That’s a lot!
If we look up more about this chip we would learn that it has 4 cores and has hyper-threading, which allows it to effectively perform 8 tasks at once.
Next we see that there is 16 Gigabytes of memory - this is how much RAM it has and also 2133 MegaHertz of low power double data rate random access memory (LPDDR3), this means that the CPU can complete one operation with the RAM 2,133,000,000 times every second.</p>
<p>If we click on the Storage button at the top, we can learn about how much storage is available on the computer. If you hover over a section, it tells you what file are accounting for that section of storage that is already being used.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_80.png" title="Mac storage information showing 1 TB capactity" alt="Mac storage information showing 1 TB capactity" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
### Checking your computer capacity - PC</p>
<p>If you have a PC or Windows computer, the steps may vary depending on your operating system, but try the following:
1. click the “Start” button - which looks like 4 squares together
2. click “Settings” button (gear-shaped)
3. click “System”
4. click “About”</p>
<p>See this <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-find-computer-specs-windows-10">link</a> for more information.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_96.png" title="Mac storage information showing 1 TB capactity" alt="Mac storage information showing 1 TB capactity" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p>Here we can see that this computer has an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00 GHz 4.00 GHz chip and 16 Gigabytes of RAM.
If we look up this chip we can see that it has 4 cores and 8 threads (due to hyper-threading) allowing for 8 tasks at a time.</p>
<p>To find out more information about your storage click the “Storage” button within the “System” tab.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_114.png" title="Mac storage information showing 1 TB capactity" alt="Mac storage information showing 1 TB capactity" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Here we can see that this computer has 466 GB + 465 GB = 932 GB across the two drives. The C drive is typically for the operating system, and the D drive is typically where you would install application programs and save files. There are 1000 GB in a TB, thus, this computer has about the same storage as the Mac that we just looked at.</p>

<div id="servers" class="section level3" number="3.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Servers</h3>
<p>What if we need to more computational power than our laptop? You may encounter times where certain informatics tasks take way too long or are not even possible on your personal computer.</p>
<p>In terms of hardware, the term <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/server">server</a> means a computer or computers that can be accessed through a direct local network or the internet to perform computations or store data. Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">here</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>For example, your lab members could connect to a server from their own computers to allow each of them more computational power. Typically computers that act as servers are set up a bit differently than our personal computers, as they do not need the same functionality. For instance they often don’t have capabilities to support a <a href="https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface">graphical interface</a> (more on what that is later). They are designed to optimize data storage and computational power.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Computing Platforms</h2>
<p>Now that we have discussed a bit about how computers perform computations, lets discuss more about how you might choose your computing platform. A computing platform, is all the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware">hardware</a> (the physical parts of your computing platform) and <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a> (the code that tells the computing platform how to function) necessary to create the environment in which you can perform your computational work.</p>
</div>
<div id="hardware" class="section level2" number="3.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Hardware</h2>
<p>With regards to hardware, there are two major options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Personal computers<br />
</li>
<li>Shared computers</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_48.png" title="A computer chip is also called the CPU.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> <strong>Personal computers</strong></h3>
<p>These are computers that your lab might own, such as a laptop, a desktop, or a small <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/server">server</a> used by just your lab.</p>

<p>If you are not performing intensive computational tasks, it is possible that you will only need personal computers for your lab. However, you may find that this changes, and you might require connecting your personal computers to shared computers for more computational power and or storage.</p>
<p>Note that you could technically purchase your own server. However, this is very likely not as economical, feasible (as having your own server would require that you personally maintain it), or salable (you might outgrow your server) as other computing options that we will discuss in a bit.</p>

<div id="shared-computers-or-networks" class="section level3" number="3.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> <strong>Shared Computers or Networks</strong></h3>
<p>These are servers (groups of computers) that are shared with other people that you can connect to from your computer (typically using the internet) to help you perform more intensive computational tasks or to store large amounts of data.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_23.png" title="A computer chip is also called the CPU.

<p>Among shared computers there are three major options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Clusters - institutional or national resources</li>
<li>Grids - institutional or national resources</li>
<li>“Cloud” - commercial or national resources</li>
</ol>
<p>AVOCADO - maybe put the image here for shared computers - check how anvil images were added within lists</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster">Computer Cluster</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In a computing cluster several of the <strong>same</strong> type of computer (often in close proximity and connected by a local area network rather than the internet) work together to perform pieces of the same single task simultaneously. The idea of performing multiple computations simultaneously is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing">parallel computing</a>.</p>
<p>There are different designs or architectures for clusters. One common one is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster">Beowulf cluster</a> in which a master computer (called front node or server node) breaks a task up into small pieces that the other computers (called client nodes or simply nodes) perform.</p>
<p>For example, if a large file needs to be converted to a different format, pieces of the file will be converted simultaneously by the different nodes. Thus each node is performing the <strong>same task</strong> just with different pieces of the file. The user has to write code in a special way to specify that they want parallel processing to be used and how.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that the CPUs in each of the node computers connected within a cluster are all performing a similar task simultaneously.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cs.wmich.edu/~elise/courses/cs626/s09/hussein/Parallel_and_Cluster_Computing.pdf">here</a> for more information.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://hazelcast.com/glossary/grid-computing/">Computer Grid</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In a computing grid <strong>different</strong> types of computers (often in different locations) work towards an overall common goal by performing <strong>different</strong> tasks.</p>
<p>The concept for grid computing is similar to that of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid">electric power grid</a>, where only computers (nodes) actively performing a task are using resources at any given time.</p>
<p>Again, just like computer clusters, there are many types of architectures that can be rather simple to very complex. For example you can think of different universities collaborating to perform different computations for the same project. One university might perform computations using gene expression data about a particular population, while another performs computations using data from another population. Importantly each of these universities might use clusters to perform their specific task.</p>
<p>Both grids and clusters use a special type of software called middleware to coordinate the various computers involved.
Users need to write their scripts in a way that can be performed by multiple computers simultaneously. Users also need to be conscious of how to schedule their tasks and to follow the rules and etiquette of the specific cluster or grid that they are sharing.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://pediaa.com/difference-between-cluster-and-grid-computing/">here</a> for more information about the difference between clusters and grids.</p>
<p>AVOCADO maybe add as a reference <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1300502" class="uri">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1300502</a></p>

<p>More recently, commercial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">“Cloud”</a> solutions are becoming a more viable hardware solution, offered by companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. This option is technically also a shared computer situation. <strong>Somewhere these companies have clusters of computers that paying customers use through the internet.</strong> In addition there are options like Jetstream which is a more “Cloud-like” part of Xsede.</p>
<p>AVOCADO need a new shared computer image and more about Jetstream which I think is a good option for many people</p>

<div id="accessing-shared-computer-resources" class="section level3" number="3.4.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Accessing Shared Computer Resources</h3>
<p>All of the shared computing options that already exist and that you could utilize involve a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center">data center</a> where are large number of computers are physically housed.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_58.png" title="A computer chip is also called the CPU.

Inside this CPU or chip  are often multiple cores, which are actually individual CPUs." width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You may have access to a <a href="https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/introduction-to-hpc-clusters/what-is-an-hpc-cluster">HPC (which stands for High Performance Computing) cluster</a> at your institute. Or you could consider using national resources like <a href="https://www.xsede.org/">Xsede</a>.</p>
<p>Your university or institution may have a HPC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster">cluster</a>, this means that they have a group of computers acting like servers that people can use to store data or assist with intensive computations. Often institutions can support the cost of many computers within an HPC cluster, allowing for what is called parallel computing. This means that multiple computers will simultaneously perform different parts of the computing required for a given task, thus significantly speeding up the process compared to you trying to perform the task on just your computer! This is also a much more cost effective option than having one expensive supercomputer (a computer that individually has the computational power of many personal computers) to act as a server. It turns out that buying several less powerful computers is cheaper.</p>
<p>AVOCADO - add image below to say cluster and grid access</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could consider an option like <a href="https://www.xsede.org/">Xsede</a>.
<a href="https://www.xsede.org/">Xsede</a> is led by the University of Illinois National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and includes 18 other partnering institutions (which are mostly other universities). Through this partnership, they currently support 16 supercomputers. Universities and non-profit researchers in the United States can request access to their computational and data storage resources.</p>
<p>Here you can see a photo of Stampede2, one of the supercomputers that members of Xsede can utilize.</p>
<p><img src="resources/images/03-Computing_Systems_files/figure-html/1B4LwuvgA6aUopOHEAbES1Agjy7Ex2IpVAoUIoBFbsq0_gf9c252d058_0_63.png" title="A computer chip is also called the CPU.

<p>[<a href="https://www.xsede.org/ecosystem/resources">source</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stampede2, generously funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through award ACI-1134872, is one of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University of Texas at Austin’s flagship supercomputers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/tacc-stampede2">here</a> for more information about how you could possibly connect to and utilize Stampede2.</p>
<p>Importantly when you use shared computers like national resources like Stampede2 available through Xsede, as well as institutional HPC clusters, you will share these resources with many other people and so you need to learn the proper etiquette for using and sharing these resources. These will vary by the shared resource, however in general:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Don’t use all nodes if you don’t need to</li>
<li>Don’t use all RAM on a node if you don’t need to</li>
<li>Communicate with others if you will be submitting a large or intensive job</li>
