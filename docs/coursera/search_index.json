This course is designed to help researchers and investigators to understand the basics of computing, to familiarize them with various computing platform options to ultimately help guide their decisions on the topic to make the most out of their research. 1.2 Target Audience This course is intended for researchers (including postdocs and students) with limited to intermediate experience with informatics research. The conceptual material will also be useful for those in management roles who are collecting data and using informatics pipelines. 1.3 Curriculum The course will cover the key underlying principles and concepts in computing. It will cover concrete discussions of the economic differences between cloud and local computing. The course will highlight a number of computing options and etiquette for using shared resources. "],["computing-basics.html", "Chapter 2 Computing basics 2.1 Computing Components 2.2 Conclusion", " Chapter 2 Computing basics First we would like to start off with some background information about how computers actually work. Note that this is one of the longer chapters of the course, as we feel that this knowledge will be very helpful for understanding what computing resources your research will actually require. This information will also better enable you to discuss your computing needs with computing experts, for example people who manage shared computing resources that you might want to use. If you are already more familiar with these topics, we hope that this chapter might fill in possible knowledge gaps, point you to more resources, or at least provide some entertaining information regarding the history and future of computers that might change your perspective. 2.1 Computing Components Luckily, you are likely not going to need to become a bee keeper to perform your computational research (unless of course that interests you)! Instead, computers rely on millions to billions of transistors. 2.1.1 Transistors Transistors are one of if not the most important basic building blocks of computers. There are many different types of transistors, but they often look like a rectangle with three prongs. Transistors behave like electronic switches or gates that either allow or do not allow current to flow through a particular part of a circuit. [Source] Inside the plastic, is often silicon, or some other semiconductive crystal. Semiconductors materials are needed because they way that they conduct electricity can be modified by the application of more electricity, making them the perfect option for creating an electrical switch. Silicon is especially useful, because it doesn’t cause the circuit to get very hot, unlike previously used materials. It is also very abundant, in fact, it is the second most common element of the Earth’s crust! (“Silicon - Wikipedia” n.d.)). If the transistor receives a small amount of current to one of the prongs (called the base), this turns it on, and allows the larger current for the circuit to pass through the transistor (from a prong called the collector to the prong called the emitter). If the base prong of the transistor does not receive a small current than the transistor is off and the current for the circuit is not allowed to flow through the transistor. These two states for the flow of current ultimately allow for the storage and use of binary data, which we think of a zeros and ones, but it is really the absence or presence of current with a voltage beyond a threshold for this part of the circuit. Thus the physical components of a computer are ultimately based on the assessment of only two states of current (0 (or FALSE) = below a threshold and 1 (or TRUE) = above a threshold), which is much easier to create than if it we needed to assess more nuanced levels of current. It turns out that this binary encoding of current as digital data is the basis for all the complex tasks that we use computers for everyday. Very importantly transistors have gotten much smaller over time. The smaller size of transistors has allowed for many more transistors to be used inside computers. Check out “Transistor Count” (2021) for more information about how the number of transistors in computers has grown over time. It turns out that early computers had only 130 or so transistors, now some super computers have trillions (“Transistor Count” 2021). [Source] Both the smaller size of the transistors and the increased number of transistors have in part allowed computers to become faster and more powerful (Pokropivny et al. 2007). Thus transistors are part of the reason we have seen such an explosion of computing power and storage and therefore also an incredible expansion of data. These silicon transistors became so important for the field of electronics, that the time period of heavy computing development during the late 20th century and early 21st century is sometimes called the “Silicon Age”. This is also why many places in the world where there are many technological institutes are often called a name with the word “silicon”, such as Silicon Valley. Here is an interesting article about what our next age might be about, and it has to do with changing the way we harness electrons (the current role of transistors) - that’s how important they are! If you would like to learn more about the history of transistors and how they work check out this website. 2.1.2 ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit The ALU is responsible for performing simple operations by using networks (in this case commonly called a circuit) of transistors. These simple operations include logical operations (such as AND, OR, or NOT etc.), and arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction, or multiplication etc.). Ultimately most of what we do everyday on our computers come down to these simple operations. These operations are based on what is called Boolean logic or Boolean algebra, which was invented by George Boole in 1854 and largely comes down to thinking of possible sets of data (“How Do Logic Gates Work?” n.d.). For example, if we have two transistors, they could both be on, they could both be off, or one or the other could be on. Considering these possibilities, we can make overall descriptions about the flow of current to perform logical operations. Let’s take a moment to understand how networks of transistors work for AND and OR operations. We call a network for a logical operation a logic gate. Note that this is a simple illustration and in actual electronics, additional transistors are often used for greater sustainability, consistency, efficiency, and speed largely based on controlling the level of current in more nuanced ways. The transistor AND gate has two transistors in series, meaning they are sequentially placed one after the other, where one receives current first before the other. A resulting high current output only occurs when both of the transistors allow for the flow of current. If either or both of the transistors is off than the current is not allowed to flow through. The transistor OR gate has two transistors in parallel, meaning they are next to one another each receiving the flow of current at the same time. A resulting high current output can occur when either of the transistors allows for the flow of current. Importantly using more complex arrangements of these logic gates can allow the computer to perform the arithmetic operations. See here and here for more information on how this works. If you would like to learn more about these gates with circuit diagrams, check out this [website] (http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Electronic/trangate.html#c1) and this website for some visualizations. This website and this website also go into great detail. In case you are wondering about the semantics of phrases like the “flow of current”, check this discussion. 2.1.3 Binary data An ALU performs arithmetic operations using values are represented in binary digits called bits (0 or 1) (recall that this is based on a state of current). Data like this is also called Boolean, because George Boole invented a system of algebra for such data in 1854 . These values do not mean their typical meanings from what we know numerically, but instead follow arithmetic rules using 2 as the base, as opposed to 10 which we are familiar with for our decimal system. What does this mean? With our decimal system when we reach a value of 10, we start to carry over the 1. With the binary system when we reach a value of 2, we start to carry over the 1. Here we can see how the first 9 digits of the decimal system are represented in the binary system. See here to learn more about binary calculations. 2.1.4 Flip-flops and registers Flip-flops are used for storing one bit of digital binary data. They are made of transistors (that’s right it’s transistors again!) and capacitors in a configuration that allows for the flip-flop to hold one of two states, thus enabling the storage of binary data. A group of flip-flops is called a register. You may have heard about a computer having a 64- or 32- bit operating system (more on what this soon). These computers have registers with 64 bits or 32 bits respectively. Thus there are 64 flip-flops within the registers of a 64-bit system. Each of these are capable of storing and processing binary values 64 digits in length (which works out to an unsigned integer in our decimal system of up to 2^64-1, or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615)! You may also be wondering how letters and other symbols are stored in this binary system. Letters are each assigned a numeric decimal value according to an encoding system such as the ASCII system, and these are converted into the binary form of the number. In the ASCII system, this ultimately works out to letters being stored by a standard 8 binary digits (or bits). A group of 8 bits (8 digits of zeros and or ones) is called a byte (“What Is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interexchange)?” n.d.). Since this is consistent, this works well with computers that have registers that can store in sets of 8 bits. In fact, that is indeed how most computers work today. The “64-bit” part of what is called a 64-bit computer indicates what is called the word size or word length, which is the maximum unit of data that the computer can work with at a time. This means that it can process binary numbers of up to 64 digits in length. Since 64 divided by 8 is 8, this means for a 64-bit computer, each register could store up to 64 bits or binary digits and thus can store 8 binary bytes. Since each letters or symbol is encode by a byte (8 bits), this means up to 8 letters or symbols can be stored by a single register at a time. Other computers may work with a 32-bit word size, meaning that the registers can accommodate only 4 bytes at a time or 32 binary digits. Below you can see the decimal value for some of the symbols and letters: Note that ASCII has largely been replaced in 1991 for Unicode, which allows for more characters, supporting languages like Chinese that require for more characters than the 256 that ASCII could support, however this works in a similar way. Here’s a video that puts everything we have explained so far together: If you want to watch another optional video that explains things further and describes how transistors are used to add numbers together check out this link. 2.1.5 CPU - Central Processing Unit The CPU is often called the brain of the computer. It is also called a core or processor. This is what people are referring to when they describe a “computer chip”. It performs and orchestrates computational tasks. The CPU is made up of several components, a few that are particularly important (two of which we have discussed): 1) ALU 2) Registers 3) Control Unit (CU) A group of these components together is called a core. The Control Unit coordinates the ALU and the data stored in the registers, so that the ALU can perform the operations on the right data stored in the registers at the right time. Modern computers now have multiple cores. What does this mean? This means that there are multiple groups of the above components that can each process data within the same computer chip. A dual core CPU is a chip with two cores. A quad-core CPU is a chip with 4 cores and so on.This allows modern computers to perform multiple tasks at the same time instead of sequentially, such as 4 tasks simultaneously on a current typical laptop (with 4 cores). This makes our computers much faster than they used to be. In addition to the main CPU, computers may be equipped with specialized processors called GPUs which stands for graphics processing units that are especially efficient at tasks involving images. Thus any tasks that require the involvement of images are done using the GPU and not the CPU. This frees up the CPU to continue on the tasks not involving images more efficiently. Hyper-threading is also an option for improving processing. This technology started in 2002 by Intel. The idea is that while part of the same core is idle or waiting for a given task, another part of the same core can work to perform another task. This isn’t as efficient as a having another core or CPU, but it does improve efficiency. So many modern computer chips actually use all three efficiency boosters (having multiple cores, having GPUs, and using hyper-threading). Thus a chip with 4 cores that also has hyper-threading can work on 8 tasks simultaneously. Since it is now much easier to produce chips with multiple cores and because there are some security concerns with hyper-threading, the field seems to be moving away from hyper-threading. 2.1.6 Memory or RAM - short-term memory OK, so we have already talked about how data can be stored in the registers within the CPU. This data or memory is used directly by the CPU during operations or tasks. However, our CPUs need additional quick access to data to tell the CPU what to do to perform the operations and what data to use. This is the data in a file that we are working with at a particular moment in time. This bring us to RAM, which stands for Random Access Memory. It is often simply referred to as memory. Ram is similarly made out of transistors and capacitors like the registers within the CPU, but it is located nearby but outside of the CPU. Since CPUs need to be fast, RAM needs to be fast, making it relatively expensive. One distinctive feature of this type of memory is that it is temporary. Data is stored in RAM for only a short time, while your computer is running a task on it, but then it disappears. Due to the fact that what is stored disappears, this type of memory is also called volatile. This is why when you are working on a file, but forget to save it, you might lose your work. For more information about how RAM works, check out this website. 2.1.7 Storage - long-term memory We can also store data that we aren’t directly using when our computer is performing operations. So for example, our excel files and word files that aren’t currently in use. This type of memory is called storage and is sometimes referred to as long-term or non-volatile memory because electricity is not required to preserve this data. This type of memory is stored using hard disk drives (HDDs) also called hard drives or more recently solid-state drives (SSDs). The reason accessing this memory is slower than accessing data stored in RAM is that it is located further away from the CPU and data needs to be transferred from the storage to the CPU along a wire when a user wants to perform operations on such data. In addition the right data needs to be found out of all of your files, which also takes some time. This type of storage allows for much larger data capacity than RAM and it is also cheaper. Hard disk drives store memory using magnetic methods, while solid-state drives store memory using chips that have guess what?? They are made of yet again the important basic building block of computers - tiny bees! Oops, I mean transistors yet again, just like the CPU chip! See, those transistors are really important. SSDs allow for much faster reading and writing of files, as well as increased reliability. However, they are more expensive and they also wear out eventually. Here’s a great explanation for how HDDs work and the difference with SSDs. It will also introduce the concept of caching, which allows for faster use of data from storage for the CPU: See this link for more information about how SSDs work, and see here for an in depth explanation. 2.1.8 Hardware and software So far we have talked about the hardware of a computer, which is the physical components of a computer, while software is the code that tells the hardware how to function. Software is also important to know about. Most importantly it is useful to know about operating systems. 2.1.9 Operating systems The operating system (sometimes simply called the OS) is a set of code or software that translates user interactions with the computer to tell the hardware (including memory and the CPU) of the computer what tasks the user wants the computer to perform and when. You can think of this as the basic code to keep the computer running and functional and to allow the user to use other forms of software, such as applications. Applications are specialized software programs like Microsoft Word, or an internet browser like Chrome that allow a user to do specific tasks on the computer. So your OS is what allows you to name, rename, move and save files. It helps you to keep track of memory and decides what memory should be used when and to run all of your application software. It also allows you to talk to other devices like printers or other computers. Examples of commonly used operating systems on computers and phones are: * Microsoft Windows (such as Windows 10, Windows 11 etc.) * macOS (notice the OS here - it might make more sense now why it is called this) * Linux * Android Recall that we previously talked about how computers today are often called 64-bit? Operating systems are also designed in this way. A 64-bit operating system expects the hardware of the computer to allow for processing at least 64 bits of data at a time (the word size). If we have registers of at least this length in the CPU, than we can in fact perform operations on data that may be up to 64 bits in length. This also means that we can perform operations on values that take up less than 64 bits. This can be important because if you try to use an operating system that expects a longer word size than the hardware can accommodate, for example a 64-bit operating system on a 32-bit computer, this will not work. Application programs are also designed according to different word sizes and again you need to choose options that are equal to or less than the word size that your CPU can accommodate. 2.1.10 Historical context Previously, back when a university might have one single computer, as they were so large and expensive (they didn’t use those nifty small transistors of today), computers didn’t have operating systems and only one task could be performed at a time by one person at a time. Back then, tasks were just manually started, prioritized, and scheduled by humans. Tasks or programs (including sometimes data) could be printed or punched on cards (called punchcards, punch cards or punched cards) that would be loaded into the machine. It could really be a pain for users if they accidentally dropped the cards for the program they wanted to run, as you can imagine! The first operating system just allowed different programs to be run sequentially without someone manually starting each one. Now our personal computers can perform multiple tasks at the same time and schedule future tasks that our automatically run. See here for more information about operating systems and here for really interesting information about the history of punched cards. Check out this really interesting Wikipedia article for more extensive history about how computer hardware was developed. Also, here is some fascinating additional reading on the role of women as computer operators starting in the 1940s. Initially computer science was actually thought of as a field for women, however this changed over time: Article titled: Woman pioneered computer programming. Then men took their industry over Article titled: Untold History of AI: Invisible Women Programmed America’s First Electronic Computer The “human computers” who operated ENIAC have received little credit 2.2 Conclusion We hope that this chapter has given you some more knowledge about how computers actually function. In conclusion, here are some of the major take-home messages: Computers rely on millions to billions of tiny transistors Transistors act like electrical switches that allow for the storage and processing of digital binary data Binary data is essentially the encoding of current states in the hardware of a computer as zeros and ones As transistors got smaller and more transistors were included in computers, computers got faster and more powerful (also due to other additional reasons) The central processing unit or CPU contains the Arithmetic Logic Unit or ALU which performs operations on data using transistor logic gates A CPU chip can contain multiple cores (also called CPUs) allowing a computer to perform multiple operational tasks at a time RAM is the memory for a computer for the tasks that its currently working on and is very fast to access because it is close to the CPU Storage on a hard drive or solid state drive is the memory for a computer that is long-term, such as files that you aren’t currently working on. It takes longer to access data from this memory as it has to travel to the CPU The operating system is what tells the computer what the user wants the computer to do and when Now that we know how a computer works in general, we will next discuss computing capacity (especially for informatics research) and how servers and cloud computing can help. avocado - add an image about RAM and CPU etc Finally, it is important to note that modern transistors are a bit different than what we have described. For example current transistors have a 3D structure that allows them to be faster, more efficient, and more densely packed because now circuits can be layered in 3D structures, thus allowing for even more transistors to be included within modern computers (“FinFET” 2021). References "],["computing-systems.html", "Chapter 3 Computing Systems 3.1 Data Sizes 3.2 Computing Capacity 3.3 File Sizes 3.4 Computing Options 3.5 Conclusion", " Chapter 3 Computing Systems In this chapter we will describe the basics about data size and computing capacity. We will discuss the computing and storage requirements for many types of cancer related data, as well as options to perform informatics work that might require more intensive computing capacity than your personal computer. 3.1 Data Sizes Recall that the smallest unit of data is a bit which is either a zero or a one. A group of 8 bits is called a byte, and most computers and phones, and software programs are constructed or designed in a way to accommodate groups of bytes at a time. For example a 32-bit machine can work with 4 bytes at a time and a 64-bit can work with 8 bytes at a time. But how big is a file that is 2 GB? When we sequence a genome, how large is that in terms of binary data? Can our local computer work with the size of data that we would like to work with? First let’s take a look at how the size of binary data is typically described and what this actually means in terms of bits and bytes: Now that we know how to describe binary data sizes, let’s next think about how much computing capacity typical computers have today. 3.2 Computing Capacity Now that we know about the CPU, how many tasks can the CPU of an average computer do these days? How much memory and storage do they typically have? What size of files can a typical computer handle? This information is sometimes called the specs of a computer. These values will probably change very soon, and different computers vary widely, but currently: Laptops can often perform 4-8 CPU tasks at once, and typically range from 4-16 GB in memory and 250 GB-1 TB of storage. This means that typical laptops can multitask quite well, have in some cases 16 gigabytes for random access memory to allow the CPU to work on relatively large tasks (as we can see from the previous table that GB are actually pretty large when you think about it), and possibly 1TB for the hard drive (and or SSD), meaning that you can store thousands of photos and files like PDFs, word documents etc. It turns out that you can store around 30,000 average size photos with 250GB, so a 1TB laptop can store quite a bit of data. Therefore overall, typical laptops today are pretty powerful compared to previous computers. Note that some programs require 16 or even 32 GB of memory to run. Desktops can perform and store similarly and sometimes to a degree better than a laptop for a similar price. Since less work needs to be done to make the desktop small and portable, sometimes you can get better storage and performance for the same price as a laptop. However, desktops often have better graphics processing capacity and displays and that might make up for the price difference. In fact, some such desktops may be the same price as a laptop but have much lower computing and storage capacity due to higher GPU capacity. Focusing on GPUs as well might be important to consider if you are going to need to visually inspect many images. Another benefit is that you can also sometimes find more expensive desktops with larger memory and storage options off the shelf than typical laptops. It is also generally easier to add more memory to a desktop than it is to add to a laptop. However of course, they certainly aren’t super portable! Some phones can compete with laptops by performing 6 CPU tasks at once and storing 6 GB in memory and 250 GB of storage.

How do you know how many cores it has or how much memory and storage it has? If you have a Mac, you can click on the apple symbol on the far left of your screen. Then click on the “About This Mac” button. You might see something like this: First we see the operating system is called Mojave. Next we see that the processor (which we now know is the CPU) is a 2.6 GigaHertz (GHz) Intel Core i7 chip. This means that the processor or CPU can process 2,600,000,000 operations in a second (this is called a clock cycle). That’s a lot! If we look up more about this chip we would learn that it has 4 cores and has hyper-threading, which allows it to effectively perform 8 tasks at once. Next we see that there is 16 Gigabytes of memory - this is how much RAM it has and also 2133 MegaHertz of low power double data rate random access memory (LPDDR3), this means that the CPU can complete one operation with the RAM 2,133,000,000 times every second. If we click on the Storage button at the top, we can learn about how much storage is available on the computer. If you hover over a section, it tells you what file are accounting for that section of storage that is already being used. 3.2.2 Checking your computer capacity - Windows/PC If you have a PC or Windows computer, the steps may vary depending on your operating system, but try the following: click the “Start” button - which looks like 4 squares together click “Settings” button (gear-shaped) click “System” click “About” See this link for more information. Here we can see that this computer has an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00 GHz 4.00 GHz chip and 16 Gigabytes of RAM. If we look up this chip we can see that it has 4 cores and 8 threads (due to hyper-threading) allowing for 8 tasks at a time. To find out more information about your storage click the “Storage” button within the “System” tab. Here we can see that this computer has 466 GB + 465 GB = 932 GB across the two drives. The C drive is typically for the operating system, and the D drive is typically where you would install application programs and save files. There are 1000 GB in a TB, thus, this computer has about the same storage as the Mac that we just looked at. 3.3 File Sizes Now let’s think about the files that we might need for our research, how big are files typically for genomic, imaging, and clinical research? Recall this table from earlier about digital data size units: 3.3.1 Genomic data file sizes Genomic data files can be quite large and can require quite a bit of storage and processing power. Here is an image of sizes of common file types: proteomics methylation human and mouse… 3.3.2 Imaging Data File Sizes Imaging data, although often smaller than genomic data, can start to add up quickly with more images and samples. Here is an image of average file sizes for various medical imaging modalities: [source] 3.3.3 Clinical Data File Sizes metabolomics? 3.3.4 Checking file sizes on Mac If you own a Mac and want to check the size of a particular file, look at your file within a finder window. You can open a new finder window by clicking on the button that looks like a square with two colors and a face, typically in the bottom left corner if your dock or the strip of icons on your screen to help you navigate to different application programs. Once you open a finder window, you can navigate to one of your files. If you have the view setting that looks like 4 lines, you will get information about the size of each file. You can right click on a file and click the “Get Info” button. This will give your more specific information. 3.3.5 Checking file sizes on PC/Windows In a similar manner to checking file sizes on a Mac, with a Windows or PC computer, you can navigate to files by first opening the File Explorer application by typing this in the search bar next to the “start” button. Then navigate to a file of interest which will show information about the size in one of the columns to the right, if you hover over the file name, you will get more specific information. 3.4 Computing Options 3.4.1 Personal computers These are computers that your lab might own, such as a laptop, a desktop, used by one individual or maybe just a few individuals in your lab. If you are not performing intensive computational tasks, it is possible that you will only need personal computers for your lab. However, you may find that this changes, and you might require connecting your personal computers to shared computers for more computational power and or storage. 3.4.2 Shared Computers or Servers What if you decide that you do need more computational power than your personal computer? You may encounter times where certain informatics tasks take way too long or are not even possible. Evaluating the potential file sizes of the data that you might be working with is a good place to start. However, keep in mind that sometimes certain computations may require more memory than you expect. This is particularly true when working with genomic or image files which are often compressed. So what can you do when you face this issue? One great option, which can be quite affordable is using a server. In terms of hardware, the term server means a computer (often a computer that has much more storage and computing capacity than a typical computer) or groups of computers that can be accessed through a direct local network or the internet to perform computations or store data. They are often shared by people, and allow users to perform more intensive computational tasks or store large amounts of data. Read here to learn more. For example, your lab members could connect to a server from their own computers to allow each of them more computational power. Typically computers that act as servers are set up a bit differently than our personal computers, as they do not need the same functionality and are designed to optimize data storage and computational power. For instance they often don’t have capabilities to support a graphical user interface(meaning the visual display output that you see on your personal computer). Instead they are typically only accessed by using a [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface, meaning that users write code instead of using buttons like they might for a program like Microsoft Word that uses a graphical user interface. In order to support this they have memory, processors or CPUs, and storage like your laptop. Here is what a server might look like: In this case we have a group of computers making up this server. Here we see the nodes (the individual computers that make up the server) stacked in columns. Among shared computers/servers there are three major options: Clusters - institutional or national resources Grids - institutional or national resources Cloud - commercial or national resources 3.4.3 Computer Cluster In a computing cluster several of the same type of computer (often in close proximity and connected by a local area network rather than the internet) work together to perform pieces of the same single task simultaneously. The idea of performing multiple computations simultaneously is called parallel computing. There are different designs or architectures for clusters. One common one is the Beowulf cluster in which a master computer (called front node or server node) breaks a task up into small pieces that the other computers (called client nodes or simply nodes) perform. For example, if a large file needs to be converted to a different format, pieces of the file will be converted simultaneously by the different nodes. Thus each node is performing the same task just with different pieces of the file. The user has to write code in a special way to specify that they want parallel processing to be used and how. It is important to realize that the CPUs in each of the node computers connected within a cluster are all performing a similar task simultaneously. See here for more information. 3.4.4 Computer Grid In a computing grid different types of computers (often in different locations) work towards an overall common goal by performing different tasks. The concept for grid computing is similar to that of an electric power grid, where only computers (nodes) actively performing a task are using resources at any given time. Again, just like computer clusters, there are many types of architectures that can be rather simple to very complex. For example you can think of different universities collaborating to perform different computations for the same project. One university might perform computations using gene expression data about a particular population, while another performs computations using data from another population. Importantly each of these universities might use clusters to perform their specific task. Both grids and clusters use a special type of software called middleware to coordinate the various computers involved. Users need to write their scripts in a way that can be performed by multiple computers simultaneously. Users also need to be conscious of how to schedule their tasks and to follow the rules and etiquette of the specific cluster or grid that they are sharing (more on that soon!). See here for more information about the difference between clusters and grids. AVOCADO maybe add as a reference https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1300502 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-grid-computing-and-cluster-computing/ “Cloud” computing] More recently, “Cloud” solutions are becoming a more viable hardware solution, offered by companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, as well as through government funding projects. This option is technically also a shared computer situation. Somewhere these companies have clusters of computers that paying customers use through the internet. However, in this case multiple servers are connected to one another to create the “Cloud”. This allows for even more computational dependability, as even if one or multiple servers is down, you can often still use the other servers for your computations. In addition to the commercial options, there are national resource options like Jetstream which is a more “Cloud-like” part of Xsede. AVOCADO need a new shared computer image and more about Jetstream which I think is a good option for many people https://go.cloudhealthtech.com/eb-simplify-the-journey-data-center-to-public-cloud.html 3.4.5 Accessing Shared Computer Resources It’s important to remember that all of the shared computing options that we previously described involve a data center where are large number of computers are physically housed. You may have access to a HPC (which stands for High Performance Computing) cluster at your institute. This can be a great cost effective and typically secure option. If your university or institution has a HPC cluster, this means that they have a group of computers acting like servers that people can use to store data or assist with intensive computations. Often institutions can support the cost of many computers within an HPC cluster. This means that multiple computers will simultaneously perform different parts of the computing required for a given task, thus significantly speeding up the process compared to you trying to perform the task on just your computer! This is also a much more cost effective option than having one expensive supercomputer (a computer that individually has the computational power of many personal computers) to act as a server. It turns out that buying several less powerful computers is cheaper. In some cases however, an institute might even have a sever with multiple supercomputers! If your institute doesn’t have a shared computing resource like the HPCs we just described, you could also consider a national resource option like Xsede. Xsede is led by the University of Illinois National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and includes 18 other partnering institutions (which are mostly other universities). Through this partnership, they currently support 16 supercomputers. Universities and non-profit researchers in the United States can request access to their computational and data storage resources. Here you can see a photo of Stampede2, one of the supercomputers that members of Xsede can utilize. [source] Stampede2, generously funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through award ACI-1134872, is one of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University of Texas at Austin’s flagship supercomputers. See here for more information about how you could possibly connect to and utilize Stampede2. Importantly when you use shared computers like national resources like Stampede2 available through Xsede, as well as institutional HPC clusters, you will share these resources with many other people and so you need to learn the proper etiquette for using and sharing these resources. We will discuss this more in a coming chapter. We will also discuss how these options might differ from cloud computing options. Importantly there are some that have been especially designed for scientists and specific types of researchers, so it is also useful to know about these options. 3.5 Conclusion We hope that this chapter has given you some more perspective on how large medical research data files can be, as well as more familiarity with how well your computer might be able to accommodate the files that you might work with. We also hope that this chapter has provided you with some more awareness about computing options that might be available to you, should you need more capacity than your current computer. In conclusion, here are some of the major take-home messages: A bit is the smallest binary digital data unit. It is a single 0 or 1. A byte is a group of 8 bits, file sizes are typically described using units based on bytes. A typical fancy laptop today might allow for up to 1 TB of storage, however this can quickly get used up if you are working with large data files. Even if you have enough storage for a large file, you might not have enough RAM to actually work with a large data file. Your computer might be too slow to handle that type of work. AVOCADO - want to say more about this A server (when describing hardware) is a single computer (typically a supercomputer if just one computer) or group of computers that others can share to help them perform more intensive computational tasks or store large amounts of data. People often connect to these over the internet, but servers can also be connected to by directly using wires in a local network (like in a department to different offices). The computers in a server are optimized for assisting users with computations or storing data. A supercomputer is a computer that has much more storage, memory, and computing capacity than a typical personal computer. Supercomputers are generally much more expensive than using a group of more typical computers that together would have the same collective computing and storage capacity. Avocado need to add this in the content! There are two general types of servers: clusters and grids. Cluster approaches work by having several computers working on pieces of the same task simultaneously in a method called parallel computing. Grid approaches work by having different types of computers working on different tasks. Cloud computing is essentially the use of many servers through some company or institute. This is often more reliable because there are many servers to use, even if one other users are performing large tasks or if a server goes down. If your institute doesn’t allow you to access a shared computing resource, you could consider options like Xsede, which is a national resource that you can request access to or some of the other options that we will describe next. AVOCADO - add image about clusters and grids "],["shared-computing-etiquette.html", "Chapter 4 Shared Computing Etiquette 4.1 General Guidelines for shared computing resources 4.2 Interacting with shared resources 4.3 Running Jobs 4.4 Storage", " Chapter 4 Shared Computing Etiquette In this chapter we will discuss the proper etiquette for using shared computing resources. This will help you to understand what would be required for you to use such resources. Different resources will have slightly different use rules, however, many will share common usage requirements. We will use the Johns Hopkins Joint High Performance Computing Exchange (JHPCE) is a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster facility as an example for guidance. For this particular resource there are 400 active users.It is optimized for genomic and biomedical research and has 4,000 cores! That’s right, as you can imagine, this is much more powerful than the individual laptops and desktops that researchers at the university have for personal use, which would typically currently only have around 8 cores. There is also 28TB of RAM and 14 PB of storage!! Now that you know more about digital sizes, you can appreciate that this server can allow for much faster processing and really large amounts of storage, as again a researchers’ computer might have something like 16 GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Individual users connect and perform jobs (aka computational tasks) on the cluster using a formal common pool resource (CPR) hierarchy system. There are 68 nodes that make up the JHPCE currently. As, with most clusters some of the nodes are dedicated to managing users logging in to the cluster and some of the nodes are dedicated to data transferring. Each node has 2-4 CPUs that provide 24-128 cores! As you can see these processors or chips have a lot more cores per each CPU than a typical personal computer. In addition the cluster also has a lot of RAM. Each node has at least 128 GB. There is also a large amount of storage, with many TB available for people to use. 4.1 General Guidelines for shared computing resources Each cluster or other shared computing resource will have different rules and requirements, but here are a few general rules to keep in make sure that you don’t accidentally abuse the privilege of sharing an amazing resource like this. Don’t be too worried, most shared resources will give you guidance about their specific rules and will often also have settings that don’t allow users to make major blunders. 4.1.1 Security guidelines use a good secure password that is not easy for someone else to guess Some people suggest using sentences that are easy for you to remember, you could consider a line of lyrics from song or poem that you like, or maybe a movie. Modify part of it to include symbols and numbers. don’t share your password and keep it safe! If you have a Mac, you could consider storing it in your Keychain, alternatively if you have a different type of computer or don’t like the Mac Keychain, consider Dashlane or other password manger services. Luckily both of these options do not come at any extra cost and can be helpful for storing all the passwords we use regularly safely. don’t access a server on a computer that is not authorized to do so Some servers will require that your computer be authorized for access for added security. It’s a good idea to follow these rules. If you can, perhaps authorize a laptop in case you might need to gain access when you need to be out of town. However if you do so, make sure you also only access a server with a secure WiFi network. One way to ensure this is is to avoid using public WiFi networks, and if you must use a public WiFi network, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) for added security. Here is an article about different VPN options. do not alter security settings without authorization Loosening security settings could pose a risk to the data stored on the server. On the other hand making more strict security settings could cause other users to not be able to perform their work. Contact the managers of the resource if you think changes need to be made. immediately report any data security concerns To protect the integrity of your data and your colleagues, be sure to report anything strange about the shared computing resource to those who manage it so that they can address it right away. Also report to them if you have any security breaches on the computer(s) that you use to access the shared computing resource. 4.1.2 Overall use guidelines don’t install software unless you have permission It is possible that the software you want to use might already be installed somewhere on the shared computing resource that you are unaware about. In addition, if you install a different version of a software program, it is possible that this version (especially if it is newer) will get automatically called by other people’s scripts. This could actually break their scripts or modify their results. don’t use the server for storage or computation that you are not authorized for (personal use) This is often a rule for shared computing resources, simply because such shared resources are intended for a specific reason and likely funded for that reason. Such resources are costly, and therefore the computational power should be used only for what it is intended for, otherwise people may view the use of the resources for other purposes as essentially theft. don’t alter configurations without authorization This could result unintended and unexpected consequences for other users. 4.1.3 Daily use guidelines When you submit jobs, make sure you follow the following guidelines. Again consider the fact that there may be more requirements for the specific resource that you might be using. Don’t use the login or transfer nodes for your computations This will cause issues for other users in terms of logging in and transferring their data. This could cause them to be unable to do their work. Think about memory allocation and efficiency Consider how much RAM and storage is available for people on the shared computing resource. Try not to overload the resource with a really intensive job or jobs that will use most of the resources and either slow down the efficiency of the work for others or not allow them to perform their work at all. This involves: * Not using too many nodes if you don’t need to * Not using too much RAM on a given node and overall if you don’t need to * Not submitting too many jobs at once * communicate with others to give them advanced warning if you are going to submit large or intensive jobs If you have a really large job that you need to perform, talk with the managers of the resource so that you can work out a time when perhaps fewer users would be inconvenienced. Consult the guidelines for your particular resource about how one let’s people know about large jobs before you email the administrators of the resource directly. 4.1.4 Communication Guidelines Use the proper order for communication Often shared resources have rules about how they want people to communicate. For example for some resources it is suggested that you first ask your friends and lab mates if you are confused about something, then consult any available forums, if that does not work then directly email the administrators/managers of the resource. Keep in mind that these people are very busy and get lots of communications. Use the ticket system If a resource has a ticket system for users to get support, use it instead of communicating by email. If such a system is in place, then the administrators running it are used to getting requests this way. If you email directly, you may not receive feedback in a timely manner or the email might get lost. 4.1.5 Specific Rules Ultimately it is very important to learn about the rules, practices, and etiquette for the resource that you are using and to follow them. Otherwise, you could lose access. Often other users are a great resource! https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/DOI-RULES-OF-BEHAVIOR-FOR-COMPUTER-NETWORK-USERS-REFERENCE-GUIDE.pdf 4.2 Interacting with shared resources Often you will need to use the command line to interact with a server from your personal computer. To do so on a Mac or a Linux computer you can typically do so using the terminal program that is already on your computer. For PC or Windows computer users, you can use programs like MobaXterm. If you wish to run a program with a graphical interface, then you might need to have a program to help you do so. On Macs, you can download XQuartz. If you use MobaXterm on your PC or Windows computer, then you will already be set. Linux computers also typically should already have what you need. If you are new to Unix commands check out this cheat sheet below. 4.3 Running Jobs Typically a program is used to schedule jobs. Remember that jobs are the individual computational tasks that you ask the server to run. For example, this could be something as simple as moving large files from one directory to another or as complex as running a complicated script on a file. In the case of the JHPCE, the use a program called Sun Grid Engine (SGE), but there are others. Such programs assign jobs to available node resources as they become available and if they have the required resources to meet the job. They have their own commands for running jobs, checking resources, and checking jobs. Remember to use what ever management system like SGE to run your jobs using the compute nodes not the login nodes. 4.3.1 Specifying memory (RAM) needs Often there is a default file size limit for jobs. For example the JHPCE has a 10GB file size limit for jobs. You may need to specify when you have a job using a file that exceeds the file size limit and set the file size for that job. (As you may recall if you are using whole genome files you are likely to exceed the default file limit size.) Often you are also given a default amount of RAM for your job as well. Again, you can typically run a job with more RAM if you specify. Similar to the file size limit, you will likely need to set the RAM that you will need for your job if it is above the default limit . Often this involves setting a lower and upper limit to the RAM that your job can use. If your job exceeds that amount of RAM it will be stopped. Typically people call stopping a job “killing” it. The lower and upper limit can be the same number. How do you know how much RAM to assign to your job? Well if you are performing a job with files that are two times the size of the file size default limit, then it might make sense to double the RAM you would typically get. It’s also a good idea to test on one file first if you are going to perform the same job on multiple files. You can then assess how much RAM the job used. First try to perform the job with lower limits and progressively increase until you see that the job was successful and not killed for exceeding the limit. Keep in mind however how much RAM there is on each node. Remember, it is important to not ask for all the RAM on a single node or core on that node, as this will result in you hogging that node and other users will not be able to use RAM on that node or core on that node. Remember that you will likely have the option to use multiple cores, this can also help you to use less RAM across each core. For example, a job that needs 120GB of RAM could use 10 cores with 12 GB of RAM each. Often there will be a limit for the number of jobs, the amount of RAM, and the number of cores that a single user can use beyond the default limits. This is to ensure that a user doesn’t use all of the resources and not allow others to perform their jobs. Check to see what these limits are and then figure out what the appropriate way is to contact to request for more. Again communication standards and workflows may vary based on the resource. 4.3.2 Checking status It’s also a good idea to check the status of your jobs to see if they worked or got killed. You can check for the expected file outputs or there are commands for the server management software that can help you check currently running jobs. 4.4 Storage Often you will be given a home directory which will likely be backed up, however, other storage directories often will not be. Be careful about where you store your data, as some directories might be for temporary use and get wiped to keep space available for others. See here for more information on how people use SGE for the JHPCE shared resource. "],["general-platforms.html", "Chapter 5 General Platforms 5.1 FireCloud 5.2 AnVIL 5.3 WebMeV 5.4 Overture", " Chapter 5 General Platforms In this chapter we will provide examples of computing systems that you might find useful for your research. Please note that we aim to provide a general overview of options and thus this is not a complete list. Let us know if there is a platform or system that you think we should include! We will start out with more general computing platforms, that allow you flexibility to perform analyses with a variety of types of data. The major advantage of these platforms is that users can analyze data where it lives. There is less need for data transfers, saving time an resources, and users can easily share data with the entire field. 5.0.1 Galaxy This section was written by Jeremy Goecks: Galaxy is a web-based computational workbench that connects analysis tools, biomedical datasets, computing resources, a graphical user interface, and a programmatic API. Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org/) enables accessible, reproducible, and collaborative biomedical data science by anyone regardless of their informatics expertise. There are more than 8,000 analysis tools and 200 visualizations integrated into Galaxy that can be used to process a wide variety of biomedical datasets. This includes tools for analyzing genomic, transcriptomic (RNA-seq), proteomic, metabolomic, microbiome, and imaging datasets, tool suites for single-cell omics and machine learning, and thousands of more tools. Galaxy’s graphical user interface can be used with only a web browser, and there is a programmatic API for performing scripted and automated analyses with Galaxy. Galaxy is used daily by thousands of scientists across the world. A vibrant Galaxy community has deployed hundreds of Galaxy servers across the world, including more than 150 public and three large national/international servers in the United States, Europe, and Australia (https://usegalaxy.org, https://usegalaxy.eu, https://usegalaxy.org.au). The three national/international servers have more than 250,000 registered users who execute &gt;500,000 analysis jobs each month. Galaxy has been cited more than 10,000 times with &gt;20% from papers related to cancer. The Galaxy Tool Shed (https://usegalaxy.org/toolshed) provides a central location where developers can upload tools and visualizations and users can search and install tools and visualizations into any Galaxy server. Galaxy has a large presence in the cancer research community. Galaxy serves as an integration and/or analysis platform for 7 projects in the NCI ITCR program. There is also increasing use of Galaxy in key NIH initiatives such as the NCI Cancer Moonshot Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and the NHGRI Data Commons, called the AnVIL (https://anvilproject.org/). Galaxy’s user interface, accessible via a web browser, provides access to all Galaxy functionality. The main Galaxy interface has three panels: available tools (left), running analyses and viewing data (middle), and a full history of tools run and datasets generated (right). Datasets for analysis in Galaxy can be uploaded from a laptop or desktop computer or obtained from public data repositories connected to Galaxy. With Galaxy, complex workflows composed of tens or even hundreds of analysis tools can be created and run. In Galaxy’s workflow interface, tools can be added and connected via a simple drag-and-drop approach. Galaxy users can share all their work—analysis histories, workflows, and visualizations—via simple URLs that are available to specific colleagues or a link that anyone can access. Galaxy’s user interface is highly scalable. Tens, hundreds, or even thousands of datasets can be grouped into collections and run in parallel using individual tools or multi-tool workflows. In summary, Galaxy is a popular computational workbench with tools and features for a wide variety of data analyses, and it has broad usage in cancer data analysis. Seehere for the list of applications supported by Galaxy. 5.0.2 Terra Terra is a biomedical research computing platform that is based on the Google Cloud platform, that also allows users easier ways to manage the billing of their projects. It provides users with access to data, workflows, interactive analyses using Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, and Galaxy, data access tools from FireCloud from the Broad Institute (a National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cloud Resource project), as well as workspaces to organize projects and collaborate with others. Terra also has many measures to ensure that data is especially secure and the offer clinical features for ensuring that health data is protected. Note that according users who do upload protected health information must select to use these extra clinical features and enter a formal agree with FireCloud about their data. Importantly users can get access to use Genotype -Tissue Expression (GTEx), Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data using the platform. See here for information on how. Users can pay for data storage and computing costs for Google Cloud conveniently through Terra. users can browse data for free. Check out this video for more information: 5.1 FireCloud Users can also specifically use FireCloud as a data analysis platform which uses Terra, much like Terra uses FireCloud for various features. At this link you can see a comparison of the two. FireCloud which is a project from the Broad institute and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Datasets accessible to Terra are also accessible through FireCloud. 5.2 AnVIL If you could use some guidance on how to perform analyses using Galaxy and Terra, especially for genomic research, check out AnVIL, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Analysis Visualization and Informatics Lab-space. It also provides access to many important genomic and related datasets from the NHGRI. According to their website: By providing a unified environment for data management and compute, AnVIL eliminates the need for data movement, allows for active threat detection and monitoring, and provides elastic, shared computing resources that can be acquired by researchers as needed. It relies on Terra for the cloud based compute environment, Dockstore for standardized tools and workflows, Gen3 for data management for querying and organizing data, Galaxy tools and environment for analyses with less code requirements, and Bioconductor tools for R programming users. 5.2.1 CyVerse CyVerse is a computing platform or cyberinfastructure similar to Galaxy that also offers computing resources for storing, sharing, and working with data with a graphical interface, as well as an API. Computing was previously offered using the cloud computing platform from CyVerse called Atmosphere, which relied on users using virtual machines. Users will now use a new version of Atmosphere with partnership with Jetstream. This allows users to use containers for easier collaboration and also offers US users more computing power and storage. Originally called iPlant Collaborative, it was started by a funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support life sciences research, particularly to support ecology, biodiversity, sustainability, and agriculture research. It is led by the University of Arizona, the Texas Advanced Computing Center, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. It offers access to an environment for performing analyses with Jupyter (for Python mostly) and RStudio (for R mostly) and a variety of tools for Genomic data analysis. See here for a list of applications that are supported by CyVerse. Note that you can also install tools on both platforms. Both CyVerse and Galaxy offer lots of helpful documentation, to help users get started with informatics analyses. See here to learn more. 5.2.2 SciServer SciServer is similar to Galaxy in that it is accessible through a web browser and allows users to store, upload, download, share, and work with data and common tools on the same platform. It was originally built for the astrophysics community (and called SkyServer) but it has now been adapted to be used by scientists of all fields and is indeed used by many in the genomics field. It allows users to use Python and R in environments like Jupyter notebooks and RStudio, and also supports (Structured Query Language) SQL for data querying and management and is built on the use of Docker. The main idea of SciServer, is based on this premise: “bring the analysis to the data”. It is free to use after users register. However, users can buy extra resources. Users can keep data private or share their data. As compared to Galaxy, this resources may be better for users with a bit more familiarity with informatics but who require more flexibility, particularly for working with collaborators such as physicists or material scientists as there are more tools supported across disciplines. In addition it also gives users access to very large data sets on Petabyte-scale (note that some of these require special permission to use) and supports developers to create their own web interfaces called SciUIs for particular use cases. For more information see https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S2213133720300664?token=D3EB0851DC2A36526E6999F0D95DA1E6C41D01E9787B690B2F06F7CE7C192B7141B9FA6BAE5DF1D4BFAD7E402540624E&amp;originRegion=us-east-1&amp;originCreation=20211028203856 5.2.3 Materials Cloud Another resource that might be of interest to Python users, particular those who collaborate with material scientists, is Materials Cloud. It is designed to promote reproducible work, collaboration, and sharing of resources among scientists, particularly for simulations for the materials science field. Users can share data in a citable way, download data, upload data, share workflows, and perform analyzes. This resource uses AiiDAlab as the computing environment for researchers, which is based on AiiDA. According to their website: AiiDAlab builds on AiiDA as the computational workflow engine, and the Jupyter environment (notebooks, widgets, …) for writing and sharing apps See here to learn more about how AiiDAlab supports the sharing of scientific workflows, particularly for those that use Python. To learn more about Materials Cloud, check out this article 5.2.4 ATLAS.ti ATLAS.ti is another option but particularly for qualitative analysis. You can use a variety of data types including video, audio, images, surveys, and social media data. A variety of tools, particularly for text data analysis are provided for methods such as sentiment analysis, which is the process of assigning a general tone or feeling to text and named-entity recognition, which is the process of extracting certain characteristics from texts that are what is called a [named entity] or a real-world object - such as a person’s name or address. Such analyses can be helpful for understanding behaviors that might be associated with cancer risk. Although this type of analysis can be performed using R or Python among other coding languages, ATLAS.ti offers a nice graphical user interface to perform these types of analyses s.Furthermore ATLAS.ti offers a great deal of flexibility about such analyses using different data types easily. 5.3 WebMeV https://webmev.tm4.org/#/about 5.4 Overture https://dcc.icgc.org/ Avocado - want to add in content about price, security, privacy/HIPAA, scalability/file/ram limits for each if possible as table "],["specific-platforms.html", "Chapter 6 Specific Platforms 6.1 WUFlux 6.2 i2B2", " Chapter 6 Specific Platforms Now we will describe some platforms that offer data storage, sharing, and analysis resources for more specific data types. 6.0.1 Imaging Data Analysis Platforms We will start with a few imaging data platforms that make it easier for researchers to perform analyses and share their data. 6.0.1.1 XNAT XNAT offers computing resources and tools for performing imaging analysis and for storing and sharing imaging data in a HIPAA complaint manner (more on that in the coming). Developed by the Bukner lab previously at the Washington University and now at Harvard, it supports a variety of imaging data as well as other data types like clinical data. Some tools can be used with a graphical interface and others with the command-line. See here for example use cases. There is also a great deal of documentation available about how to use the tools and resources available at https://wiki.xnat.org/documentation. 6.0.1.2 OHIF The open health imaging foundation (OHIF) is a web-based imaging analysis platform that is widely used, particularly for radiology analysis, but it also supports whole-slide microscopy image analysis. It was developed by Gordon Harris et al. and can be used for a variety of applications from cardiology to veterinary medicine. Check out these example use cases of OHIF. OHIF also provides thorough documentation with images and videos about how to use the image viewer and tools available. Price: free For those interested, Gordon Harris and others are also working on a project called Cornerstone, with the goal of providing software for others to display medical images in web browsers. 6.0.2 QuIP 6.0.3 IB server? 6.0.4 PRISM The Platform for Imaging in Precision Medicine called PRISM allows users to work with the vast data available from r the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). According to Fred Prior: It is designed to collect, curate and manage Radiology and Pathology images, clinical information associated with those images, annotations and image derived feature sets. PRISM is designed to run on a Kubernettes cluster, but all of the components are containerized so they can run stand-alone or in an alternate orchestration framework.

Include how to purchase a computer! To afford you the best opportunity to perform the informatics research that you would like, it is useful to become familiar with computing options and costs. This course aims to provide research leaders with some guidance about making decisions for computing hardware (the physical parts of your computing platform) and software (the code that tells the computing platform how to function). It will also describe the benefits and drawbacks of local and “Cloud” computing, as well as the associated costs of each. Note: This content was adapted from content by Frederick Tan for the AnVIL project. See his course created with Jeff Leek, Sarah Wheelan, and Kai Kammers here. 7.1 Computing Platforms Now that we have discussed a bit about how computers perform computations and computing options, lets discuss more about how you might choose your computing platform. A computing platform, is all the hardware (the physical parts of your computing platform) and software (the code that tells the computing platform how to function) necessary to create the environment in which you can perform your computational work. Choosing a computing platform involves both software and hardware decisions. 7.2 Choosing a Computing Platform Choosing a computing platform depends on many different considerations. 7.2.1 Important questions Asking yourself and your research team these questions can help you find the right computing platform: Do I need a graphical interface, a command line interface, or both? What do we mean by this? A graphical interface or graphical user interface or GUI, allows for users to choose functions to perform by interacting with visual representations. They have a “user-centered” design that creates a visual environment where users can for example click on tabs, boxes, or icons for to perform functions. Galaxy offers a graphical interface for performing analyses and tasks. For example in the following image we show a GUI for joining two files: A command line interface (also known as a character interface) allows for software functions to be performed by specifying through commands written in text. This typically offers more control than a graphical interface, however command line interfaces are often less user friendly as they require that the user know the correct commands to use. For example, one could perform functions in R using Bioconductor packages such as Biostrings with a command line interface: A situation where you might use both a command line interface and a GUI, is using RStudio to perform an analysis in R with Bioconductor packages. RStudio is what is called an IDE or an integrated development environment, which is an application that supports writing code. There are many tools to help you including a console for writing code in R with command line interfacing, as well as graphical interface tools. As shown in this example below, one can inspect and save a plot (that was created with the command line) by using a GUI. 2) Am I working with protected data that requires special security precautions? If you are working with data that might be protected by HIPAA, such as electronic health records, then special security measures are required to ensure that only authorized users have access to the data. [source] How computationally intensive are my tasks? If you have a large amount of data and/or are performing complex analyses, you may require more computational power than your current laptop can provide. If this is the case, you might consider using a local server or what is called “Cloud” computing (more on that later). How much storage space do I need for both temporary and long-term data? If you are working with large datasets you may also need storage options that go beyond what you currently have available. Local or “Cloud” storage options may work for you, depending on other considerations (security, data transfers) that we will discuss further. Avocado - I want to modify this to highlight the difference between cloud computing by companies vs Xsede Are my local resources sufficient? When a local solution already works, one may rightly question the time required to migrate to the Cloud. However, when local solutions are insufficient or unsustainable, then the Cloud becomes a competitive option. Am I working with especially big or controlled access datasets? Increasingly large datasets like the NCBI Sequence Read Archive are being stored on the Cloud. If your work relies on being able to access the entire dataset, then the Cloud may be your only practical option. Furthermore, if you work with controlled access data, then more platforms are providing compliance with regulations like HIPAA and FedRAMP. Do I need to work with collaborators? Computational research increasingly involves larger and larger collaborations. While many fragmented systems exist to share work, the Cloud presents an opportunity for everyone to share the exact same computational environment including hardware, software, and datasets. If Cloud Computing makes sense for you, then you’re in luck! The past decade has seen the development of many efforts to make Cloud computing, easier, faster, and more affordable. As each platform has their strengths and weaknesses, we will now discuss several opportunities and challenges that Cloud computing presents in the field of computational genomics. 7.2.2 Benefits of Cloud Computing The state of Cloud computing is continually evolving. Here, we highlight three main current benefits: https://jetstream-cloud.org/files/Jetstream-Outreach-C2Exchange-Sep2019.pdf Sharing Workflows The first major benefit is the increasing ease with which one can share and collaborate on research projects. Shown here is the History feature of Galaxy. Using this, one can share not only what datasets they used but also every computational manipulation that was performed. By sharing such a history, one can reproduce an analysis in its entirety, allowing collaborators to offer comments and extend upon the work with ease. Sharing Workflows between Platforms While sharing complete analysis histories is for the most part constrained to a particular software platform, a second benefit that has arisen is the ability to share Workflows between platforms. Shown here is a diagram of a single cell analysis pipeline published by the Klarman Cell Observatory on Dockstore: This higher level abstraction coupled with container technology allows this multistep analysis to be run with relative ease on supporting platforms like Terra or DNAnexus. Using Commodity Hardware The third Benefit we highlight is the increasing ease by which one can provision commodity hardware at scale. What this means is that you can pay reasonable costs to complete your analysis in less time by renting hundreds to tens of thousands of Cloud-based computers – importantly stopping the bill when your analysis is complete. Specialized hardware like GPUs and large memory nodes are also available for rent allowing you to pay only for what you need. 7.2.3 Challenges of Cloud Computing Balancing these three benefits are four challenges: Data Transfer Data transfer and data management remains a cumbersome task. While storing data in the “Cloud” has its advantages, it also has corresponding storage costs. Thus, careful planning is necessary with regards to what data will be stored where, as well as budgeting the time necessary to transfer data back and forth. Data Security Most Cloud resources offer features that make it easier to access and share data, and these features often come at the expense of security. Thus, special precautions must be implemented to securely store protected datasets such as human genome sequences and electronic health records. Costs Controlling costs, especially with regards to storage, presents a third formidable challenge. As many Cloud providers naturally want to encourage usage of their platforms, users must be aware of how much money is currently being spent and be able to project how much money is likely to be spent in the future. We will briefly overview cost controls in the next section. While software platforms can help mitigate these challenges, Cloud computing still incurs costs from the underlying hardware providers. IT A final challenge is that many IT support staff do not have extensive experience managing Cloud resources. Should IT choose to support analysis on the Cloud, they would face the aforementioned challenges of understanding and supporting data management, security compliance, and cost management. Fortunately, large initiatives like AnVIL, Galaxy, and CyVerse continue to work on democratizing access to Cloud computing by tackling many of these challenges. 7.3 Local Costs 7.4 Cloud Costs "],["data-security.html", "Chapter 8 Data Security 8.1 Data Security Strategies 8.2 Data access 8.3 Data masking 8.4 Data erasure 8.5 Data resiliency 8.6 Security in workflows", " Chapter 8 Data Security In this chapter we will discuss best practices for keeping your data safe and secure. Data security involves protecting your data from human error, as well as from cybercriminals. Precious data needs to be protected from being corrupted (rendered unusable), being deleted, being misused, and being leaked to the public when the data is sensitive or private (as is the case with much of our clinical data)(“What Is Data Security? Data Security Definition and Overview” n.d.). 8.1 Data Security Strategies There a several major strategies to achieve data security. We will cover the following 4 major categories, in part according to “What Is Data Security? Data Security Definition and Overview” (n.d.). 8.2 Data access 8.2.1 Authentication Authentication is the process of verifying identification. This goes both ways when a user attempts to use a server. Servers will check that a user (client) is who they claim to be and that they are authorized to access the information on the server. The user’s computer (client) will also check that the server is what it claims to be. Typically users will use a user name and password for the server to confirm identity, however your computer often checks a certificate from the server to confirm it’s identity (“Understanding Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption : TechWeb : Boston University” n.d.). 8.2.2 Authorization Authorization is the process of verifying that a client has permission to access a file or computing resource in a particular way, which leads us to permissions (“Understanding Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption : TechWeb : Boston University” n.d.). 8.2.3 Permissions If you use the command line, you may have noticed that files are sometimes listed with letters like so: These letters indicate the users ability to perform tasks for each file called file system permissions. In unix or unix-like systems, there are three types of users: Owner (sometimes called user) - This is the person that created the file by default Group users - groups can be created to more easily give the correct permissions for various files for a similar group of users. Other users - This is any other user who might come into access with the file There are generally 3 types of permissions: read (r) - the user can read the contents of the file, or the user can just read file names in the case of a directory (or folder) write (w) - the user can modify the file, or the user can create or delete files in the case of a directory (or folder) execute (x) - the user can execute a file - this allows the operating system to run the file, for example a user could run a script, or the user can search among files in the case of a directory (or folder) Values for permission follow a standard form: The first value indicates information about the file type, if it is a regular file it is often just a -. This does not indicate any information about permissions. If it is a link to a file located somewhere else it is indicated with an l. The next 3 values indicate what the owner of the file can do. They are always listed in the order of read, write, and execute permissions. The next three values indicate what the group members can do (again with the order listed above). the final three values indicate what other users can do (again with the order listed above) (“File-System Permissions” 2021). Sometimes you will see an @ or + symbol at the end, which indicates that there are additional attributes about the file that you can use a command like ls-al@ filename to get the information, or additional security information about the file, which you can obtain using a command like ls -le filename or getfacl filename. The command that you should use depends on your operating system. In the above image we see -rwxr-xr-x for one of the files. The - at the beginning indicates that the file is a regular file, the next 3 values of rwx indicate that the owner has read, write, and execute permissions, the r-x indicates that the group has read and execute permissions but not write, and the last r-x indicate that the other users also have only read and execute permissions. There are commands to modify file permissions. If you are using a Unix-like system, you can modify permissions with the chmod command, which stands for “change mode” (“Manage File Permissions on Unix-Like Systems” n.d.). 8.2.3.1 The principal of least privilege The principal of least privilege (PoLP) also called the principal of least authority specifies that users should only have access to the data or resources necessary to complete a task. If someone does not need access to perform work, they should not be given access. Furthermore, if someone is given access to perform a task and they complete that task, access should then be removed from that person. Additionally, if someone only needs to read a file, then they do not need access to modify the file. In this case a user can have read permissions but not write permissions. Ultimately this type of management leads to the least number of users having access to read or alter protected or sensitive data at a given time (“Least Privilege CISA” n.d.; “Wikipedia: Principle of Least Privilege” 2021). As an example of this in practice: If a postdoc is working on a project with sensitive data, and the PI does not need to see the raw data to collaborate on the project, then the PI should not have access to the data. 8.2.4 WiFi 8.2.5 Passwords 8.2.6 Stale access 8.2.7 Flash drives.. not sure where to put this… 8.3 Data masking Encryption is actually just one of the more complex methods of a larger concept called data masking for protecting sensitive data. There are other methods for obscuring parts of the data besides the complexity of encryption, such as the following: 8.3.1 De-identification https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html https://opin.com/de-identify-health-information-phi-v2/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification #### Safe harbor #### Expert Determination #### Limitations 8.3.2 Encryption Encryption is one of the most well-known methods for keeping data safe. It is used as a last method in case unauthorized users can access to data, and it is also used to protect data when transferring it. The process involves encoding or scrambling the data in a nonrandom format (we call this form of the data encrypted) that given the right instructions, a computer can reformat into the original form in a process called decryption. The instructions called the key are kept safe like a password and depending on the type of encryption, it can require quite a lot of computational power to decrypt the data. This protects the data because if a cybercriminal accesses the data or if the data is somehow made public when it shouldn’t be, it will not be easily interpreted (“What Is Data Encryption?” 2018). There are different methods for encrypting data. One common method is called asymmetric, which involves two keys, a public key and a private key (“What Is Encryption? Data Encryption Defined” n.d.). This method is also sometimes simply called public key. Users can get access to the public key to allow them to encrypt the data, while the private key remains private and is used to decrypt the data. This method is also called public-key encryption (“What Is Encryption? Data Encryption Defined” n.d.). Symmetric cryptography on the other hand uses one key for encryption and decryption. In systems that use this type of encryption, pairs of users will often be given their own key. The advantage of this system is that decryption is a bit faster, the keys are smaller, and it is generally less expensive to implement. If someone gains access to the key, however they can decrypt data or messages, and encrypt data or messages and appear as if they are the person that owns that key. So often the keys themselves are encrypted (“What Is Encryption? Data Encryption Defined” n.d.). Since symmetric decryption is faster, it is often used for transferring data or for large datasets.Common symmetric algorithms are AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 (Labs n.d.). Asymmetric encryption is regarded to be more secure, common algorithms included RSA and DSA, and several PKCS standards (Labs n.d.). These algorithms involve mathematical operations to encrypt the data. See this video for a simplified explanation and a suggestion for a video series if you want to learn more about how these encryption algorithms work: 8.3.2.1 SSL Socket Layer This is what the s in https is for. This indicates that data from the server is using a form of encryption and that the website server has a special SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority that verified that the server can be trusted. There is actually a lot happening behind the scenes! According to “What Is SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)? What Is an SSL Certificate? DigiCert” (n.d.) this involves the following steps: A web browser (like chrome) connects to a web server (website) that is secured with SSL (it starts with https instead of http). The browser asks the server to identify itself. The Server sends a copy of the SSL certificate and the public key. The browser checks the certificate to make sure that it comes from a trusted certificate authority and that the certificate has not expired or been revoked. The browser also checks that the names on the certificate and the website match. It then sends the server an encrypted session key based on the public key. The server then decrypts the session key using the private key and sends an encrypted acknowledgment to start an encrypted session. The server and browser can now transmit encrypted data back and forth. Note that newer versions of this process are called Transport Layer Security (TLS). 8.3.2.2 SSH Secure Shell SSH is also a process for securely transmitting files from one computer to another using encryption. However, in this case it can be done using a command line interface instead of a browser. SSH also does not involve certificate. https://sectigostore.com/blog/ssh-vs-ssl-exploring-the-similarities-and-differences/ https://www.jscape.com/blog/ssl-vs-ssh-simplified 8.4 Data erasure It turns out that when you delete a file (even after emptying the trash), it isn’t as “deleted” as you might think. This is because when a file is deleted, the data for that file actually stays on the storage hardware, and it’s simply the computer’s ability to find the data that is hindered. However, there is software that can help people recover data on storage hardware. This can be a great security issue, as sensitive data can remain on people’s hardware when they get a new computer or stop using particular data on a server. One method to ensure that the deleted data is really eliminated is to physically destroy the hardware that it was stored on. However, this isn’t always necessary, as there are methods using software. This option is great because the hardware can be reused without allowing future users potential access to your data. As you might imagine, this is the preferred method for erasing data on shared computing resources like servers (Tilly Holland 2020). These methods erase the data by overwriting the data with random digital information (“Data Erasure” 2021). 8.5 Data resiliency 8.6 Security in workflows References "],["data-privacy.html", "Chapter 9 Data Privacy", " Chapter 9 Data Privacy Cancer research often involves personal health data that requires compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.

Now that labs all over the world are producing massive amounts of data, there are many discoveries that can be made by just using this existing data.
